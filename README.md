# 📚 Classroom Chatbot – Smart Assistant for Students

An AI-powered assistant designed to simplify classroom communication, reduce the workload of Class Representatives (CRs), and help students get quick and accurate updates without waiting for faculty responses.

---

## **🧠 Overview**

• The Classroom Chatbot is a smart digital assistant that handles classroom updates, reminders, and student queries.

• It ensures that students receive instant answers about assignments, events, and deadlines, while CRs and faculty avoid answering the same questions repeatedly.

• The system supports personal queries, group announcements, file sharing, automatic reminders, anonymous question handling, and also allows students to create their own groups.

### **💬 4. Personal AI Chatbot**

Students can ask questions such as:

• “When is the next assignment due?”

• “When is the class test?”

• “What updates were posted today?”

If the information exists in the system, the chatbot answers instantly.

If not, it moves the question to the Smart Query Handling System.

### **🧭 5. Smart Query Handling System**

When the chatbot cannot answer a question:

• It asks whether the question should be forwarded to the correct admin or CR

• Student chooses:

* Send with name
* Send anonymously
* Don’t send

• Admin receives the query
• Admin replies
• Student receives the reply privately

This reduces repeated questions and ensures accurate answers for everyone.

---

### **🕵 6. Anonymous Mode**

Anonymous mode allows students to ask doubts without revealing their identity.

How it works:

• Student asks a question

• If the chatbot cannot answer, it asks whether to forward the question

• If Anonymous is selected, the message is forwarded as:

* From: Anonymous User

Admin cannot see:

• Name

• Roll number

• Email

• User ID

Admin replies normally, and the system delivers the answer to the student privately.

Why anonymous mode is important:

• Helps shy students ask doubts

• Encourages open communication

• Useful for personal or sensitive questions

• Avoids fear of judgment

• Query is only sent if the student approves it
