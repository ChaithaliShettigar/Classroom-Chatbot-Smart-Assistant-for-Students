📚 Classroom Chatbot – Smart Assistant for Students

An AI-powered assistant designed to simplify classroom communication, reduce the workload of Class Representatives (CRs), and help students get quick and accurate updates without waiting for faculty responses.

🧠 Overview

The Classroom Chatbot is a smart digital assistant that handles classroom updates, reminders, and student queries.
It ensures that students receive instant answers about assignments, events, and deadlines — while CRs and faculty avoid answering the same questions repeatedly.
The system supports personal queries, group announcements, file sharing, automatic reminders, and anonymous question handling.

💬 4. Personal AI Chatbot

Students can ask:

“When is the next assignment due?”

“When is the class test?”

“What did the CR post today?”

If the information exists in the system → Chatbot answers instantly.
If not → The chatbot moves to the Smart Query System (below).

🧭 5. Smart Query Handling System

When the chatbot cannot answer:

It asks the student whether the query should be forwarded to the CR/Admin.

Student chooses:

Send with name

Send anonymously

Don’t send

Query reaches the correct admin

Admin responds

Student receives the answer privately

This reduces repeated student questions and ensures every doubt gets answered.

🕵 6. Anonymous Mode (Clear Explanation)

Anonymous mode allows students to ask doubts without revealing their identity.

✔ How It Works:

Student asks a question.

If chatbot cannot answer, it asks:
“Do you want to send this question to Admin? (Anonymous or With Name)”

If Anonymous is selected:

The question is forwarded as:

From: Anonymous User


Admin cannot see:

Name

Roll number

Email

User ID

Admin replies normally.

The system delivers the answer to the student privately.

✔ Why Anonymous Mode Is Important:

Helps shy students ask doubts

Encourages open communication

Safe for sensitive or personal questions

Reduces fear of judgment

Maintains full privacy

Nothing is sent unless the student approves it.
